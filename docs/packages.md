# Additional Packages

Additional packages as listed on this page can be added to the Installer. 
These packages include freely available software, packaged up neatly so that they are installed with minimal required interaction.<br>

- To install them put the files into the **Install** folder of the FAT32 drive - insert the SD into your PC's reader and this will be the only partition accessible.<br>
- When the Amiga has booted, navigate to the **PiStorm** folder and double-click on the **Install Packages** icon. 
- The Installer will do the rest - though bear in mind that after reading disclaimers, then Enter key may need to be pressed to progress.

Note, only install files with the required installation script will work.

** Currently Available packages:**

## WHDLoad Demos

All available Demos that have WHDLoad versions. The Imager already installs the latest **WHDLoad Wrapper** so they will have the most compatible settings applied before they run.<br>
About 650MB will need to be available on your FAT32 drive and around 930MB free on the Work: Partition where the Demos will be installed.

The package can be downloaded here: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hQvmtpAc6XORclGtoqkZl1uGSf0QAr-3)

**NOTE**: A lot of demos require a specific Kickstart image is installed to the Devs:Kickstarts folder. Functionality to make this as painless as possible has been provided; please refer to the [TransferKick section](amigautilities.md#transferkick) for instructions on this feature.
