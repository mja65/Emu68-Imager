# Additional Packages

You can add additional packages to the Installer. These packages include freely available stuff packaged up neatly and they are installed with minimal required interaction.<br>
To install them put the files into **Install** folder of the fat32 drive (the only drive that you can access on your Windows).<br>
When you boot your Amiga go into **Pistorm** folder and click on **Install Packages** icon. The Installer with do the rest for you. You might need to press Enter after reading the disclaimers.
