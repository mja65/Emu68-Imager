# Additional Packages

You can add additional packages to the Installer. These packages include freely available stuff packaged up neatly so that they are installed with minimal required interaction.<br>
To install them put the files into the **Install** folder of the fat32 drive (the only drive that you can access on your Windows machine).<br>
When you boot your Amiga go into **PiStorm** folder and click on the **Install Packages** icon. The Installer will do the rest for you. You might need to press Enter after reading the disclaimers.

**Available packages:**

## WHDLoad Demos

All available Demos that have WHDLoad versions. The Imager already installs the latest **WHDLoad Wrapper** for you so they will have the most compatible settings applied before they run.<br>
You will need about 650Mb free on your Fat32 drive and around 930Mb free on your Work: Partition where the Demos will be installed.

You can download the package here: [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hQvmtpAc6XORclGtoqkZl1uGSf0QAr-3)

**NOTE**: A lot of demos require you to install a specific Kickstart image into Devs/Kickstarts folder. Please refer to the [TransferKick section](amigautilities.md#transferkick) on how to do that.
