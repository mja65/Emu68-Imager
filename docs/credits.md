## Credits

There are several people responsible for this in several different ways. Most of the blame goes to the person on top though.

- SupremeTurnip
- Tom-Cat
- Shaytan
- Lemaru
- ZX Dunny
- Flype

Credit also to the mountain-load of testing undertaken by Shaytan to get this working for version 2.0.  

We want to thank the PiStorm team that has made all of this possible. We appreciate the dedication and all the work they put into making the best accelerator for the Amiga along with constant improvements along the way (and all this free of charge):

- Claude
- Michal
- Paraj
- Everyone else that has contributed in any way

Thanks also to Henrik NÃ¸rfjand Stengaard for creating HST-Imager and HST-Amiga. Emu68 Imager would not exist without these tools.
