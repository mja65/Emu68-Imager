# Emu68 Imager tool installation instructions

Installing the tool is straightforward. Extract the downloaded zip folder to a destination of your choice. In order to avoid having to redefine the Working Path it is best to extract to a drive with plenty of space (while the tool will provide a calculation of required space, it is just over the space of the SD card itself.)

Once you have extracted the tool you will see a file called PistormImagerGui.cmd in the extracted directory. Running the tool is as simple as double-clicking on this file. Refer to [Emu68 Imager tool Instructions](instructions.md)
