# Emu68 Imager tool installation instructions

Installing the tool is straightforward. 

- Extract the downloaded zip folder to a destination of your choice. 
- In order to avoid having to redefine the Working Path it is best to extract to a drive with plenty of space
- While the tool will provide a calculation of required space, it is typically more than the space of the SD card itself.
- Once you have extracted the tool, double click the file called **Emu68ImagerGui.cmd** in the extracted directory. For versions prior to 2.0 the file is called  **PistormImagerGui.cmd**. 
- The tool requires Administrator level access in order to access the SD card. Be sure to accept the request to elevate priviliges when it appears. If you do not accept this message the tool will exit. 
- Now refer to [Emu68 Imager tool Instructions](instructions.md)
