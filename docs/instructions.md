# Emu68 Imager tool instructions

This is a more detailed description of the options available to you in the image creation tool, and should be studied closely if you want to take full advantage of the flexibility it offers.

It should be noted that the Imager tool requires Administrator access rights - it cannot manipulate media devices without it. It is safe to use, but as always - handle with care. The Tool is self-elevating, so grant access when you run it. 

Depending on the version you are running, please refer to the relevant section of this page. For version 1.x, please refer to the [Version 1.X page](InstructionsEmu68ImagerV1.md).  For version 2.x, please refer to the [Version 2.X page](InstructionsEmu68ImagerV2.md)
