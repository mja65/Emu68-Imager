- Select the desired SD card from the drop down control
- Select the desired OS version
- Copy the Kickstart ROM and all installation ADF floppy images to a folder on your disk (refer to [ADF Images](instructions.md#supplying-kickstart-rom-and-workbench-installation-floppies) section)
- Select the Kickstart folder by clicking on `Click to set Kickstart Path` button
- Select the ADF Images folder by clicking on `Click to set ADF Path` button
- Select the Screen Mode of your HDMI monitor in the drop down box
- If the button `Run Tool` is red it means you have not completed the required information. At any time you can press this button and the tool will tell you what is missing
- The button `Run Tool` should turn green if there was enough space on your disk. If you have insufficient space, the button will turn yellow and give you the opportunity to select a different drive
