# Amiga Utilities instructions

When Imager finishes writing the image on your SD card you can insert it into the SD card slot of your RaspberryPi.<br>
After turning your amiga on you should see the Emu68 Logo on your HDMI output.<br>

## First Time Run

The Amiga should have both HDMI monitor and standard Amiga monitor connected, since both are used on the First run!<br>
First time the SD card is run there will be several additional things done :

## Buptest

Buptest is a test performed by Emu68 to check that the pistorm is functioning properly. On your HDMI output you will see several lines of output. If all is well the test should be succesfull and your Amiga will continue booting the Emu68. From now on the output will be on your normal Amiga monitor output.
